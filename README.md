# Whacking Space
This is a terrible pixel art space game I created to start getting familiar with the power of pygame.
While the game has some short-comings, it is fun to play and does exhibit how easy it is to getting 
started with making games using Python and the pygame modules. All pixel art was custom-made using GIMP software!
